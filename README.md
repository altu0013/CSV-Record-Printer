# CSV-Record-Printer

The code is a practical project that reads data from a CSV file using the csv library and prints the records on the screen. It defines a class called VegetablesRecord to create objects representing the data in each row of the CSV file. The code opens the CSV file, skips the first row (column names), and then reads each row, creating a VegetablesRecord object and adding it to a list. Finally, it prints the first 200 rows of the dataset. If the file is not found or cannot be opened, appropriate error messages are displayed. The name "Caner Altun" is printed at the beginning and end of the program.

Please note that the code assumes the existence of a CSV file named "32100260.csv" in the current directory.
